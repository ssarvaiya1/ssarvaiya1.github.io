## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6 Part 2

Blackjack Score was a fascinating lab that deepened my understanding of Blackjack and provided valuable practice with code functions. It was the first time I wrote functions specifically designed for a card game, and it felt rewarding to see them work together to calculate the correct hand value, including scenarios with multiple Aces.

* Lab 9 Part 2

The Guessing a Secret Number lab introduced me to file I/O, where I learned to read and write data to files. I practiced error handling to ensure program robustness and validated user input and file contents. This lab provided a solid foundation for building more complex file-based applications.

* Lab 8 part 1

The Olympic Judge Average lab involved calculating a fair average score by eliminating outliers. We implemented a JudgeAverage function to handle this task, ensuring accurate calculations using floating-point arithmetic. This lab provided valuable practice in data manipulation and function design.
